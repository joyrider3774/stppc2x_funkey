Inertia
=======

You are the green circle.  You have to collect all 
the blue diamonds without hitting the black mines.  

Some squares are solid wall (grey blocks).  Other 
squares are "stop" spaces (faint circles).

When you move in a direction, you will "slide" until
you hit a wall, "stop"-space or bomb!

A-click on a square next to the circle to slide in 
that direction.  You can slide diagonally.
