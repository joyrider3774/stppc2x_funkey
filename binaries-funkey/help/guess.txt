Guess
=====

Guess the secret colour code.  Enter your guesses 
by placing colours into the grid, using the top line
for your first guess, then test your guess.  

In the result, black dots mean that you have a 
correct colour in the correct position, white dots 
mean you have a correct colour in an incorrect position.

Hold A and move the joystick to drag the colours to 
the positions.

Press A on the four blue circles once you have 
entered your guess to see the results.

Press B on a circle in your guess to automatically
copy it each time.
