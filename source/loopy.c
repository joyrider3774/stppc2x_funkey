/*
 * Possible future solver enhancements:
 * 
 *  - There's an interesting deductive technique which makes use
 *    of topology rather than just graph theory. Each _face_ in
 *    the grid is either inside or outside the loop; you can tell
 *    that two faces are on the same side of the loop if they're
 *    separated by a LINE_NO (or, more generally, by a path
 *    crossing no LINE_UNKNOWNs and an even number of LINE_YESes),
 *    and on the opposite side of the loop if they're separated by
 *    a LINE_YES (or an odd number of LINE_YESes and no
 *    LINE_UNKNOWNs). Oh, and any face separated from the outside
 *    of the grid by a LINE_YES or a LINE_NO is on the inside or
 *    outside respectively. So if you can track this for all
 *    faces, you figure out the state of the line between a pair
 *    once their relative insideness is known.
 *     + The way I envisage this working is simply to keep an edsf
 * 	 of all _faces_, which indicates whether they're on
 * 	 opposite sides of the loop from one another. We also
 * 	 include a special entry in the edsf for the infinite
 * 	 exterior "face".
 *     + So, the simple way to do this is to just go through the
 * 	 edges: every time we see an edge in a state other than
 * 	 LINE_UNKNOWN which separates two faces that aren't in the
 * 	 same edsf class, we can rectify that by merging the
 * 	 classes. Then, conversely, an edge in LINE_UNKNOWN state
 * 	 which separates two faces that _are_ in the same edsf
 * 	 class can immediately have its state determined.
 *     + But you can go one better, if you're prepared to loop
 * 	 over all _pairs_ of edges. Suppose we have edges A and B,
 * 	 which respectively separate faces A1,A2 and B1,B2.
 * 	 Suppose that A,B are in the same edge-edsf class and that
 * 	 A1,B1 (wlog) are in the same face-edsf class; then we can
 * 	 immediately place A2,B2 into the same face-edsf class (as
 * 	 each other, not as A1 and A2) one way round or the other.
 * 	 And conversely again, if A1,B1 are in the same face-edsf
 * 	 class and so are A2,B2, then we can put A,B into the same
 * 	 face-edsf class.
 * 	  * Of course, this deduction requires a quadratic-time
 * 	    loop over all pairs of edges in the grid, so it should
 * 	    be reserved until there's nothing easier left to be
 * 	    done.
 * 
 *  - The generalised grid support has made me (SGT) notice a
 *    possible extension to the loop-avoidance code. When you have
 *    a path of connected edges such that no other edges at all
 *    are incident on any vertex in the middle of the path - or,
 *    alternatively, such that any such edges are already known to
 *    be LINE_NO - then you know those edges are either all
 *    LINE_YES or all LINE_NO. Hence you can mentally merge the
 *    entire path into a single long curly edge for the purposes
 *    of loop avoidance, and look directly at whether or not the
 *    extreme endpoints of the path are connected by some other
 *    route. I find this coming up fairly often when I play on the
 *    octagonal grid setting, so it might be worth implementing in
 *    the solver.
 *
 *  - (Just a speed optimisation.)  Consider some todo list queue where every
 *    time we modify something we mark it for consideration by other bits of
 *    the solver, to save iteration over things that have already been done.

     * a) two non-equivalent faces.
     * b) two non-equivalent faces, and one of them is part of a different

     * An occurrence of a) means there is at least one loop.
     * An occurrence of b) means there is more than one loop.

     *
     * While we're at it, we set a flag if we find a YES edge that is not
     * part of a loop.
     * This information will help decide, if there's a single loop, whether it
     * is a candidate for being a solution (that is, all YES edges are part of

/* DLines:
 * For general grids, we consider "dlines" to be pairs of lines joined
 * at a dot.  The lines must be adjacent around the dot, so we can think of
 * a dline as being a dot+face combination.  Or, a dot+edge combination where
 * the second edge is taken to be the next clockwise edge from the dot.
 * Original loopy code didn't have this extra restriction of the lines being
 * adjacent.  From my tests with square grids, this extra restriction seems to
 * take little, if anything, away from the quality of the puzzles.
 * A dline can be uniquely identified by an edge/dot combination, given that
 * a dline-pair always goes clockwise around its common dot.  The edge/dot
 * combination can be represented by an edge/bool combination - if bool is
 * TRUE, use edge->dot1 else use edge->dot2.  So the total number of dlines is
 * exactly twice the number of edges in the grid - although the dlines
 * spanning the infinite face are not all that useful to the solver.
 * Note that, by convention, a dline goes clockwise around its common dot,
 * which means the dline goes anti-clockwise around its common face.

/* PROPOSED NEW DESIGN:
 * We have a work queue consisting of 'events' notifying us that something has
 * happened that a particular solver mode might be interested in.  For example
 * the hard mode solver might do something that helps the normal mode solver at
 * dot [x,y] in which case it will enqueue an event recording this fact.  Then
 * we pull events off the work queue, and hand each in turn to the solver that
 * is interested in them.  If a solver reports that it failed we pass the same
 * event on to progressively more advanced solvers and the loop detector.  Once
 * we've exhausted an event, or it has helped us progress, we drop it and
 * continue to the next one.  The events are sorted first in order of solver
 * complexity (easy first) then order of insertion (oldest first).
 * Once we run out of events we loop over each permitted solver in turn
 * (easiest first) until either a deduction is made (and an event therefore
 * emerges) or no further deductions can be made (in which case we've failed).
 *

 *    * How do we 'loop over' a solver when both dots and squares are concerned.
 *      Answer: first all squares then all dots.

    /* Given a set of dline atmostone/atleastone constraints, need to figure
     * out if we can deduce any further info.  For more general faces than
     * squares, this turns out to be a tricky problem.
     * The approach taken here is to define (per face) NxN matrices:
     * "maxs" and "mins".
     * The entries maxs(j,k) and mins(j,k) define the upper and lower limits
     * for the possible number of edges that are YES between positions j and k
     * going clockwise around the face.  Can think of j and k as marking dots
     * around the face (recall the labelling scheme: edge0 joins dot0 to dot1,
     * edge1 joins dot1 to dot2 etc).
     * Trivially, mins(j,j) = maxs(j,j) = 0, and we don't even bother storing
     * these.  mins(j,j+1) and maxs(j,j+1) are determined by whether edge{j}
     * is YES, NO or UNKNOWN.  mins(j,j+2) and maxs(j,j+2) are related to
     * the dline atmostone/atleastone status for edges j and j+1.
     *
     * Then we calculate the remaining entries recursively.  We definitely
     * know that
     * mins(j,k) >= { mins(j,u) + mins(u,k) } for any u between j and k.
     * This is because any valid placement of YESs between j and k must give
     * a valid placement between j and u, and also between u and k.
     * I believe it's sufficient to use just the two values of u:
     * j+1 and j+2.  Seems to work well in practice - the bounds we compute
     * are rigorous, even if they might not be best-possible.
     *
     * Once we have maxs and mins calculated, we can make inferences about
     * each dline{j,j+1} by looking at the possible complementary edge-counts
     * mins(j+2,j) and maxs(j+2,j) and comparing these with the face clue.
     * As well as dlines, we can make similar inferences about single edges.
     * For example, consider a pentagon with clue 3, and we know at most one
     * of (edge0, edge1) is YES, and at most one of (edge2, edge3) is YES.
     * We could then deduce edge4 is YES, because maxs(0,4) would be 2, so
     * that final edge would have to be YES to make the count up to 3.
     */

    /* Much quicker to allocate arrays on the stack than the heap, so
     * define the largest possible face size, and base our array allocations
     * on that.  We check this with an assertion, in case someone decides to
     * make a grid which has larger faces than this.  Note, this algorithm
     * could get quite expensive if there are many large faces. */
