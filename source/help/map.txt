Drag and drop the colours into each region so that
every region is coloured and no two neighbouring 
regions have the same colour.  It's always possible 
with just four colours.

The "pencilled" colours help you try out colours 
without committing to them.  You can have a region
which contains multiple "pencilled" colours.

Move the joystick while pressing A to drag a colour 
from one region to another.

Move the joystick while pressing B to drag a 
"pencilled" colour from one region to another.

Drag from a white region to clear a colour.
You cannot change the initial regions.
