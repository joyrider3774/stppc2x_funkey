Maze 3D
=======

Navigate the maze to find the exit. The maze is fully 3D
(so don't forget to check up and down too!)

A-click on the window to *turn* in that direction, 
e.g. click the top part of the window to turn upwards, 
the left part to turn left, etc.

B-click to mark squares to help you remember where
you've been.

For your first few games, you may find it helpful to 
play on a "2D" maze (height 1) or "solve" a puzzle and 
follow the yellow trace towards the exit.
