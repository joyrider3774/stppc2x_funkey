Dominosa
========

Find the position of the full set of dominoes, which 
is hidden in the grid.  Some dominoes may be 
horizontal and some vertical.

Mark out every domino tile within the grid so that 
they are all present and there are no duplicates.

The options allow you to use smaller or larger sets
of dominoes.

A-click between two numbers to put a domino over them.
B-click between two numbers to place a "no domino" 
barrier.
