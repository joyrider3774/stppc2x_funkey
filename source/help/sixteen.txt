Sixteen
=======

This is a sliding-tile puzzle.  Slide the tiles using the
arrows until they are in order, 1-16, top-to-bottom, 
left-to-right.

Similar to "fifteen" but this time you have to slide 
rows/columns as if they were a Rubik's Cube to get 
the numbers into numerical order.

A-click the arrows to slide a row/column.
A-click the arrows to slide a row/column the other way.
