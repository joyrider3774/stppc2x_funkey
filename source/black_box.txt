Blackbox
========

Find the hidden balls in the box by bouncing laser 
beams off them.  There are some very complicated 
rules about when it bounces which you may be able 
to work out for yourself by looking at the computer 
solution.

A-Click the outer edges to fire a laser.
A-Click the inner squares where you think the hidden 
balls are
A-Click the green circle to see if your guess is 
correct.
