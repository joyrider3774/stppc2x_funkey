//Mouse in gamelist menu
Make delete autosave do the double-check.
Bug in dragging in pattern when using scaled large screen
//Build a clean version, put it in a clean set of dirs and test thoroughly.
//Wrapper script (or put in a command-line argument that STOPS it re-spawning the menu)
//Get new screenshots of tents (stray dots) and loopy (new version)
//Re-write text for loopy
//Map - make the handles optional
//Make 640x480's play on a rotozoom screen?

// Check out new slant code (8187)
// Music selection & smooth fading between tracks
// Blackbox's 4-10 configuration option
// Add tags with author, track, etc. back into oggs
// Timer bugs in "solve on Untangle" (make sure mines timer still works and doesn't persist out of menu)
// Auto-save game persistence (save on good exit, save on game change).
// Resolve order issues for autosave games and configs when loading
//  - If we load autosave first, the config will not match the game
//  - If we load config first, it will be overwritten by autosave
//  - Also, if we have an autosave, we need to be able to physically delete it
//    (when autosave is turned off?)
// Preset menu - scroll presets
// SETTINGSMENU - saveing of "autosave" setting to ini, and others.
Mouse jumps when entering menus - makes you hit the wrong menu item
// Mines timers persists into menu
// Cursor input (use Select key to switch between control schemes?)
// Deleting save games
// Menu layout for 640x480  (especially Saves and Presets).
// Send ASSERTS.TXT to ST?
Replace fe->paused with current_screen != INGAME throughout and remove fe->paused.
// When setting new config options, ask for verification on exit of the menu?
Check mouse action as a F-200 (does it need the bit I stripped out to see F-200 mouse "clicks" 
properly?)
Fix F-200 (merge & rewrite input layer?) - check senorduck's sdl.
Downclocking - Doesn't save much?
// Copy game as string to "clipboard"
Interruptible generation
Double-check loading thread func spacing on screen

// Undo/Redo keys (automatically gives us "undo restart game")
// Deleting default config (press a button in the menu?)
// - Make it so that you can hold a key on the gamelist menu to "ignore" the config instead?
// Check drawing functions for that off-by-one
// Add config presets (need to update to latest SVN to get which_preset)
// Fix menu so that stray keypresses/ mouse presses don't trigger the previous game to redraw.
// (rare crash related to the about menu, or did I imagine it?)
// Unusual crashes after many threads?
// Merge menu
// Fix map to show "locked" countries
// Fix black edges coming out of loading screen
// Fix Maze3D menu text size

// Multi-layered menu
