Guess
=====

Guess the secret four-colour code.  Enter your 
guesses by dragging the colours on the left into 
the grid, using the top-line for your first guess.  
The results appear on the right once you have 
entered your colours - black dots mean correct 
colour in the correct position, white dots mean 
correct colour but incorrect position.

Hold A and move the joystick to drag the colours to 
the positions.
