/*
 * solo.c: the number-placing puzzle most popularly known as `Sudoku'.
 *
 * TODO:
 *
 *  - reports from users are that `Trivial'-mode puzzles are still
 *    rather hard compared to newspapers' easy ones, so some better
 *    low-end difficulty grading would be nice
 *     + it's possible that really easy puzzles always have
 *       _several_ things you can do, so don't make you hunt too
 *       hard for the one deduction you can currently make
 *     + it's also possible that easy puzzles require fewer
 *       cross-eliminations: perhaps there's a higher incidence of
 *       things you can deduce by looking only at (say) rows,
 *       rather than things you have to check both rows and columns
 *       for
 *     + but really, what I need to do is find some really easy
 *       puzzles and _play_ them, to see what's actually easy about
 *       them
 *     + while I'm revamping this area, filling in the _last_
 *       number in a nearly-full row or column should certainly be
 *       permitted even at the lowest difficulty level.
 *     + also Owen noticed that `Basic' grids requiring numeric
 *       elimination are actually very hard, so I wonder if a
 *       difficulty gradation between that and positional-
 *       elimination-only might be in order
 *     + but it's not good to have _too_ many difficulty levels, or
 *       it'll take too long to randomly generate a given level.
 * 
 *  - it might still be nice to do some prioritisation on the
 *    removal of numbers from the grid
 *     + one possibility is to try to minimise the maximum number
 * 	 of filled squares in any block, which in particular ought
 * 	 to enforce never leaving a completely filled block in the
 * 	 puzzle as presented.
 *
 *  - alternative interface modes
 *     + sudoku.com's Windows program has a palette of possible
 * 	 entries; you select a palette entry first and then click
 * 	 on the square you want it to go in, thus enabling
 * 	 mouse-only play. Useful for PDAs! I don't think it's
 * 	 actually incompatible with the current highlight-then-type
 * 	 approach: you _either_ highlight a palette entry and then
 * 	 click, _or_ you highlight a square and then type. At most
 * 	 one thing is ever highlighted at a time, so there's no way
 * 	 to confuse the two.
 *     + then again, I don't actually like sudoku.com's interface;
 *       it's too much like a paint package whereas I prefer to
 *       think of Solo as a text editor.
 *     + another PDA-friendly possibility is a drag interface:
 *       _drag_ numbers from the palette into the grid squares.
 *       Thought experiments suggest I'd prefer that to the
 *       sudoku.com approach, but I haven't actually tried it.

/*
 * Solo puzzles need to be square overall (since each row and each
 * column must contain one of every digit), but they need not be
 * subdivided the same way internally. I am going to adopt a
 * convention whereby I _always_ refer to `r' as the number of rows
 * of _big_ divisions, and `c' as the number of columns of _big_
 * divisions. Thus, a 2c by 3r puzzle looks something like this:
 *
 *   4 5 1 | 2 6 3
 *   6 3 2 | 5 4 1
 *   ------+------     (Of course, you can't subdivide it the other way
 *   1 4 5 | 6 3 2     or you'll get clashes; observe that the 4 in the
 *   3 2 6 | 4 1 5     top left would conflict with the 4 in the second
 *   ------+------     box down on the left-hand side.)
 *   5 1 4 | 3 2 6
 *   2 6 3 | 1 5 4
 *
 * The need for a strong naming convention should now be clear:
 * each small box is two rows of digits by three columns, while the
 * overall puzzle has three rows of small boxes by two columns. So
 * I will (hopefully) consistently use `r' to denote the number of
 * rows _of small boxes_ (here 3), which is also the number of
 * columns of digits in each small box; and `c' vice versa (here
 * 2).
 *
 * I'm also going to choose arbitrarily to list c first wherever
 * possible: the above is a 2x3 puzzle, not a 3x2 one.

 * Solver.
 * 
 * This solver is used for two purposes:
 *  + to check solubility of a grid as we gradually remove numbers
 *    from it
 *  + to solve an externally generated puzzle when the user selects
 *    `Solve'.
 * 
 * It supports a variety of specific modes of reasoning. By
 * enabling or disabling subsets of these modes we can arrange a
 * range of difficulty levels.
 */

/*
 * Modes of reasoning currently supported:
 *
 *  - Positional elimination: a number must go in a particular
 *    square because all the other empty squares in a given
 *    row/col/blk are ruled out.
 *
 *  - Numeric elimination: a square must have a particular number
 *    in because all the other numbers that could go in it are
 *    ruled out.
 *
 *  - Intersectional analysis: given two domains which overlap
 *    (hence one must be a block, and the other can be a row or
 *    col), if the possible locations for a particular number in
 *    one of the domains can be narrowed down to the overlap, then
 *    that number can be ruled out everywhere but the overlap in
 *    the other domain too.
 *
 *  - Set elimination: if there is a subset of the empty squares
 *    within a domain such that the union of the possible numbers
 *    in that subset has the same size as the subset itself, then
 *    those numbers can be ruled out everywhere else in the domain.
 *    (For example, if there are five empty squares and the
 *    possible numbers in each are 12, 23, 13, 134 and 1345, then
 *    the first three empty squares form such a subset: the numbers
 *    1, 2 and 3 _must_ be in those three squares in some
 *    permutation, and hence we can deduce none of them can be in
 *    the fourth or fifth squares.)
 *     + You can also see this the other way round, concentrating
 *       on numbers rather than squares: if there is a subset of
 *       the unplaced numbers within a domain such that the union
 *       of all their possible positions has the same size as the
 *       subset itself, then all other numbers can be ruled out for
 *       those positions. However, it turns out that this is
 *       exactly equivalent to the first formulation at all times:
 *       there is a 1-1 correspondence between suitable subsets of
 *       the unplaced numbers and suitable subsets of the unfilled
 *       places, found by taking the _complement_ of the union of
 *       the numbers' possible positions (or the spaces' possible
 *       contents).
 * 
 *  - Mutual neighbour elimination: find two squares A,B and a
 *    number N in the possible set of A, such that putting N in A
 *    would rule out enough possibilities from the mutual
 *    neighbours of A and B that there would be no possibilities
 *    left for B. Thereby rule out N in A.
 *     + The simplest case of this is if B has two possibilities
 * 	 (wlog {1,2}), and there are two mutual neighbours of A and
 * 	 B which have possibilities {1,3} and {2,3}. Thus, if A
 * 	 were to be 3, then those neighbours would contain 1 and 2,
 * 	 and hence there would be nothing left which could go in B.
 *     + There can be more complex cases of it too: if A and B are
 * 	 in the same column of large blocks, then they can have
 * 	 more than two mutual neighbours, some of which can also be
 * 	 neighbours of one another. Suppose, for example, that B
 * 	 has possibilities {1,2,3}; there's one square P in the
 * 	 same column as B and the same block as A, with
 * 	 possibilities {1,4}; and there are _two_ squares Q,R in
 * 	 the same column as A and the same block as B with
 * 	 possibilities {2,3,4}. Then if A contained 4, P would
 * 	 contain 1, and Q and R would have to contain 2 and 3 in
 * 	 _some_ order; therefore, once again, B would have no
 * 	 remaining possibilities.
 * 
 *  - Recursion. If all else fails, we pick one of the currently
 *    most constrained empty squares and take a random guess at its
 *    contents, then continue solving on that basis and see if we
 *    get any further.

 *
 * This grid generator works by essentially trying to solve a grid
 * starting from no clues, and not worrying that there's more than
 * one possible solution. Unfortunately, it isn't computationally
 * feasible to do this by calling the above solver with an empty
 * grid, because that one needs to allocate a lot of scratch space
 * at every recursion level. Instead, I have a much simpler
 * algorithm which I shamelessly copied from a Python solver
 * written by Andrew Wilkinson (which is GPLed, but I've reused
 * only ideas and no code). It mostly just does the obvious
 * recursive thing: pick an empty square, put one of the possible
 * digits in it, recurse until all squares are filled, backtrack
 * and change some choices if necessary.
 *
 * The clever bit is that every time it chooses which square to
 * fill in next, it does so by counting the number of _possible_
 * numbers that can go in each square, and it prioritises so that
 * it picks a square with the _lowest_ number of possibilities. The
 * idea is that filling in lots of the obvious bits (particularly
 * any squares with only one possibility) will cut down on the list
 * of possibilities for other squares and hence reduce the enormous
 * search space as much as possible as early as possible.
