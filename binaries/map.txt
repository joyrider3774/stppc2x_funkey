Map
===

Drag and drop the colours so that the map is filled
and no two "countries" next to each other have the 
same colour.  It's always possible with just the 
four colours.

Move the joystick while pressing A to drag a colour 
from one country to another.

Move the joystick while pressing B to drag a 
"pencilled" colour from one country to another.

The guess colours help you try out colours without 
committing to them.
