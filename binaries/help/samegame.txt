Same Game
===========================================

Clear the grid of all squares.

You can only clear a group of squares if there 
are two or more same-coloured squares touching 
each other.

When cleared, the rest of the squares will 
"fall" down and left.  If you can't clear any
more groups, the game is over.  If there are
any squares left on the grid, you have lost.

Your score depends on how many groups you clear
and how large they were.  Larger groups score 
more
