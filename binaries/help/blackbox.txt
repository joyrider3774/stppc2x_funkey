Blackbox
========

Find the hidden balls in the box by bouncing laser beams 
off them.  A beam travels in a straight line from the 
outer edge.  If it encounters a ball head-on, it is 
absorbed (indicated by an "H").  

If a beam encounters a ball in front and to the left, it 
will then turn 90 degrees to the right and vice versa.  

If a beam ends up leaving the grid at the same point it 
entered (or is "deflected" before it enters the grid), 
an "R" is shown.

A-Click the outer edges to fire a laser.
A-Click the inner squares to mark the balls.
A-Click the green circle to check your guess.
B-Click to mark sqaures, rows or columns empty.
