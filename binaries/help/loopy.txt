Loopy
=====

Your aim is to draw a single unbroken loop of black
lines along the grid.  It does not have to touch 
every region.

The regions that contain numbers have that many of 
their edges as part of the loop.  Some of these 
regions will be inside the loop, and some will be
outside.

The options will let you use non-square regions
such as honeycombs and kite-shapes.

A-click on a yellow line to draw a line.
A-click again to make it yellow.
B-click on a line to remove it entirely.
B-click again to make it yellow.
