=======

Complete the "latin square" so that no row or
column has a repeating number in it, and the 
"greater than" symbols hold true 
(e.g. 4 > 2 but not 1 > 2).

The default game uses the numbers 1-4 but the
options allow you to change the size.

Use L and R to select the number to enter.  
A-click to select a box and press X to actually 
enter the number.
B-click to select a box and press X to enter
some provisional numbers.
