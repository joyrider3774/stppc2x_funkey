TODO:
  Fix drag-drop display problems in several games
  Fix "mines" so it works on GP2X
  Add hardware SDL / window zoom
  Add parameter passing (difficulty, size etc.)
  Add save/load game (already in place, just need code to write to file)
  
  Fix off-by-one errors in drawing code
  Create SDL menu for all the games?

Test results:

  Blackbox - OK
  Bridges - OK.  Strange dragging "feel".  Right-click problems when trying to unlock islands?
  Cube - OK
  Dominosa - OK
  Fifteen - OK
  Filling - OK
  Flip - OK
  Galaxies - OK
  Guess - Drag-drop display artifacts left behind.
  Inertia - Animation display artifacts left behind.
  Light Up - OK
  Loopy - OK.  No solver, though?
  Map - Drag-drop display artifacts left behind.  Odd stray lines.
  Mines - GP2X - Weird crash on line 599 with assert, shows mines at start.  Memory?
        - PC - No crash, no mines, doesn't terminate properly on lose/win?
  Net - OK
  Netslide - OK
  Pattern - OK.  Font a little too small, because of default size of game.
  Pegs - Very slow drag-drop.  Caused by heavy primitives drawing at all times during a drag.
         Doesn't appear fixable from SDL code - it's just too much work for the poor GP2X to 
         draw like that all the time while dragging.  Upstream game needs some optimisation.
         A pity because that's the only game that displays the drag-drop properly!
  Rectangles - OK
  Same Game - OK
  Sixteen - OK
  Slant - OK
  Solo - OK
  Tents - OK
  Twiddle - OK
  Unequal - OK - ideally needs different number range (1-4?) but playable without.  Screen update problem?
  Untangle - OK
