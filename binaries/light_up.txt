Light Up
========

You have to place lightbulbs in squares to light up
every free space without breaking the rules.  A 
number in a square means that it is adjacent to only 
that number of lightbulbs (diagonals don't count).  
No lightbulb can "light" another lightbulb by being
in the same row or column.

A-click to place a lightbulb.
