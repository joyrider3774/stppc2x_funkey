This file gives you a quick rundown of all the games and how to play them, along 
with some very basic controls to get you started playing.  PUZZLES.TXT has much
more information on gameplay, extra controls etc.

The joystick/D-pad works like a mouse with A, Y, B as left-,middle- and right-click.
Press Start for a new game
Press Select to restart a game
Press L+R together to quit
Press Vol+/Vol- together to have the computer solve the puzzle (if possible)

For games which need you to enter numbers:
Press L and R to cycle through the possible numbers
Press X to enter the number (you may have to A-click the cell first).

Blackbox
========

Find the hidden balls in the box by bouncing laser beams off them.  There are some
very complicated rules about when it bounces which you may be able to work out for
yourself by looking at the computer solution.

A-Click the outer edges to fire a laser from that square.
A-Click the inner squares to enter where you think the hidden balls are
A-Click the green circle to see if your guess is correct.

Bridges
=======

Connect all the islands with a network of bridges.  Each island has a number, which 
is the number of bridges that it connects to.  Each bridge may be single or multiple.
All the islands have to join together and have the right number of bridges.

Move the joystick while holding button A to build a bridge.  Press A on an island to
"lock" it.  Press A+Y on an island to "unlock it" (can be a little tricky).

Cube
====

Pick up all the blue squares by rolling the cube over them.

A-click on a square to roll the cube onto it.

Dominosa
========

Find the position of the full set of dominoes, i.e. mark out the 0-0, 0-1, 0-2, 0-3,
...,6-4,6-5,6-6 tiles within the grid.

A-click between two numbers to put a domino over them.

Fifteen
=======

This is like one of those sliding-tile puzzles.  Slide the tiles using the empty 
space until they are in order, top-to-bottom, left-to-right, 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-15
and then the space.

A-click on a number next to the space to slide it into the space.

Filling
=======

Mark out the whole grid so that each square has a number and is within a group of
the same number, such that the group has the same amount of tiles as its number.

E.g.:

3231  <-- see how the 3's are in groups of three 3's, 2's are in groups of two 2's
3233      and 1's are in groups of one 1's so that the entire grid is filled.
3122

Use L and R to select a number, A-click to select a square and then X to enter the 
number in the square.

Flip
====

Flip groups of squares to light them all up at once.  Each click flips the square 
you click, plus the ones directly above, below, to the right and left.

A-click to flip a square.

Galaxies
========

Divide the grid into regions that can be symmetrically rotated 180 degrees around 
their central dot.

A-click on the line between squares to draw a line and box off the regions you want.

Guess
=====

Guess the secret four-colour code.  Enter your guesses by dragging the colours on 
the left into the grid, using the top-line for your first guess.  The results appear 
on the right once you have entered your colours - black dots mean correct colour 
in the correct position, white dots mean correct colour but incorrect position.

Hold A and move the joystick to drag the colours to the positions.

Inertia
=======

You are the green circle.  You have to collect all the diamonds without hitting
the black circular mines.  Some squares are solid.  Other squares are "stop" 
spaces.  When you move in a direction, you will "slide" until you hit a wall, 
"stop"-space or bomb!

A-click on a square next to the circle to slide in that direction.  You can slide
diagonally.

Light Up
========

You have to place lightbulbs in squares to light up every free space without 
breaking the rules.  A number in a square means that it is adjacent to only that
number of lightbulbs (diagonals don't count).  No lightbulb can "light" another
lightbulb by being in the same row or column.

A-click to place a lightbulb.

Loopy
=====
Draw a single unbroken loop along the dots within the grid.  The squares that contain
numbers have to have that many of their edges as part of the loop.

A-click between two dots to draw a line between them.

Map
===

Drag and drop the colours so that the map is filled and no two "countries" next to
each other have the same colour.  It's always possible with just the four colours.

Move the joystick while pressing A to drag a colour from one country to another.
Move the joystick while pressing B to drag a "pencilled" colour from one country to another.
The guess colours help you try out colours without committing to them.

Mines
=====

Minesweeper!  Clear all the squares except the mines.  A number in a square indicates
how many of its eight neighbours are mines.

A-click to reveal a square.

Net
===

Rotate each square to complete the network.  Each square should be joined to the 
network and "powered" with electricity which comes from the central square.

A-click to rotate a square clockwise, B-click to rotate anti-clockwise.

Netslide
========

Similar to net, but this time you have to slide the squares like a Rubik's Cube and
not rotate them.

A-click the arrows to slide a row or column.

Pattern
=======

Also known as nonograms or "paint by numbers".  Fill in the randomly-generated picture
by using the clues.  The numbers indicate the lengths of runs of black squares in the
row or column they are in.  E.g. 2 3 indicates that there is a run of two black before
a run of three black somewhere in that column.

A-click to mark a square black.  B-click to mark it white.

Pegs
====

Also known as solitaire (not the card game!).  Jump pegs over one another (removing
the "jumped" peg as in draughts/checkers) until only one remains.

Hold A and move the joystick to drag a peg

Rect
====

Divide the grid into rectangles with areas equal to their numbers.  So a 4 would be
inside a 2x2 or a 4x1 rectangle.

A-click on the lines between squares to build up the edges of the rectangles.

Same Game
=========

Clear the grid of all squares.  You can only click a square if two or more 
same-coloured squares are touching each other.  They will then disappear and 
the rest of the squares will "fall".

A-click to remove a group of square.

Sixteen
=======

The same as fifteen but this time you have to slide rows/columns as if they were a 
Rubik's Cube to get the numbers into numerical order.

A-click the arrows to slide a row/column.

Slant
=====

Draw a diagonal line in every box so that the numbered boxes have that number of 
diagonal lines touching their circles.  

Zero's have to be diamonds:     Four's have to be crosses:

/ \                                     \ /
 0                                       4
\ /                                     / \

A-click a square to change it between a blank and the two types of diagonal line.

Solo
====

Also known as Sudoku.  Enter a number into every square so that each line, column 
and 3x3 box on the grid contains the numbers 1-9 without any repetitions.

Use L and R to pick a number, then A-click on a square and press X to enter the 
number.

Tents
=====

Place a tent next to each tree so that there are the same number of tents as trees, 
no two tents are adjacent and the number of tents in each row/column matches the 
numbers on the sides of the grid.

A-click to insert a tent into a square.

Twiddle
=======

A bit like Fifteen.  Rotate the tiles to form 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 in order on the grid.

A-click on an intersection to rotate the tiles around it.

Unequal
=======

Complete the "latin square" so that each row/column has the numbers 1-4 in it and
the "greater than" symbols hold true (e.g. 4 > 2 but not 1 > 2).

Use L and R to select the number to enter.  A-click to select a box and press X
to actually enter the number.

Untangle
========

Drag the points out so that none of the lines cross any other.

Hold A and move the joystick to drag a point.
