Filling
=======

Mark out the whole grid so that each square has a 
number and is within a group of the same number, 
such that the group has the same amount of tiles 
as its number.  So all 3's are in a touching group
that has three 3's in it, etc.

Use L and R to select a number, A-click to select a 
square and then X to enter the number in the square.
