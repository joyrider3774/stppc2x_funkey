Bridges
=======

Connect all the islands with a network of bridges.
Each island has a number, which is the number of 
bridges that it has.  The connections between 
islands may use more than one bridge.

All the islands have to join together and have the 
right number of bridges.

Move the joystick while holding button A to build a 
bridge.  Press A on an island to "lock" it.  Press 
A+Y on an island to "unlock it".
