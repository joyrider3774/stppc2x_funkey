Also known as nonograms or "paint by numbers".  
Fill in the randomly-generated picture by using the 
clues.  The numbers indicate the lengths of runs of
black squares in the row or column they are in.  

E.g. 2 3 indicates that there is a run of two black
before a run of three black somewhere in that 
column.

A-click to mark a square black.  
B-click to mark it white.
Y-click to mark it as unknown.
