Inertia

You are the green circle.  You have to collect all 
the diamonds without hitting the black circular 
mines.  Some squares are solid.  Other squares are 
"stop" spaces.  When you move in a direction, you 
will "slide" until you hit a wall, "stop"-space or 
bomb!

A-click on a square next to the circle to slide in 
that direction.  You can slide diagonally.
