=======

This is a sliding-tile puzzle.  Slide the tiles using the
empty space until they are in order, 1-9, top-to-bottom, 
left-to-right, with the space in the bottom-right 
square.

A-click on a number next to the space to slide that 
number into the space.
You can A-click a number more than one position away if
all intermediate pieces can move too.
