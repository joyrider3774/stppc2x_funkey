Filling
=======

Mark out the whole grid so that each square has a 
number and is touching a group of the same number.
Each group has to have the same amount of tiles as 
its number.  So all 3's are in a touching group
that has three 3's in it, etc.

Groups will highlight themselves when they are full
but they may not be correct.

Use L and R to select a number, A-click to select a 
square and then X to enter the number in the square.
