Rectangles
===========================================

Divide the grid into rectangles.  Each rectangle
must contain a number and the area of that 
rectangle should be equal to that number.

So a 4 would be inside a 2x2 or a 4x1 rectangle.

A-click on the lines between squares to build up 
the edges of the rectangles.
A-drag to draw a rectangle directly onto the grid.
