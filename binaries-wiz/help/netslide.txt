Netslide
========

Slide each row in order to complete the network.

Every blue "node" should be joined to the network 
and "powered" with electricity which comes from the 
central square.

Red barriers prevent electricity from flowing 
through them.

Similar to net, but this time you have to slide 
the squares like a Rubik's Cube and not rotate them.

A-click the arrows to slide a row or column.
B-click the arrows to slide a row or column the other 
way.
